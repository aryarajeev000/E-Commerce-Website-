**Database Connection**
The MongoDB connection is established using Mongoose, and environment variables are managed using the dotenv package.

**User Authentication**
User Registration, login, and JWT-based authentication have been implemented. The backend uses bcrypt for password hashing and protects certain routes with middleware.

**Category and Product Management**
The admin can create, update, and delete categories and products. Image uploads are handled as part of the product creation process.

**Frontend**
React Setup
The front end is built with React. It includes components for various pages and uses React Router to navigate between them.

**Admin Panel**
The admin panel includes features for managing categories, products, and orders. It provides CRUD operations for both categories and products.

**Shopping Cart**
The shopping cart allows users to add, update, and remove products. Users can view their order history, and admins can manage order statuses.
